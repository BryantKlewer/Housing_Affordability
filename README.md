# project-one

## Purpose
* This project will be assessing US housing costs trends between 2011 and 2021 for single family homes in the 75 most populated cities compared to median incomes. Additionally, we will be using machine learning will attempt to determine when housing in these cities became unaffordable, more than 1/3 of median monthly income, as well as give these locations an afordability score. Housing affordability has become a hot button topic over the last few years across America and determining housing affordability can be utilized to help individuals make a determination on where to live and still be able to afford a quality life.  Data is being pulled from the US Censusus Bureau, both Census data and the American Community Survey (ACS), which includes: median housing cost, median real estate taxes, median household income, median mortgage rates, housing characteristics, populations, and miscellaneous demographical data. 

## Communication protocols
* Team member contact information has been distributed via excel file with phone, email and best contact time. We are meeting 5-7 times weekly on Google Meetings or Discord to update what work has been completed and assessing next steps. In the event of a situation where an individual is stuck, slack, email, or phone calls to team members to get assistance is expected.
